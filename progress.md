#progress so far

code so far has been implemented for back-end.
only basic functionality of understanding pdf has been implemented.
<br/>

pdf_summary.py contains the basic feature to extract text data from resume and provide summary of it. using this as a template for any further pdf content extraction tasks.
<br/>

main.py is the current back-end i'm working on. trying to provide a fairly sized placement data file as chunks for the model to analyse before performing comparison with student resume
<br/>

api keys have been hidden since this is a public platform.
also the "resume.pdf" path mentioned in the codes implies that the resume is in the same directory as the project. if your resume is in a different directory provide the path instead of the pdf name directly.
<br/>
update openai and all other libraries to latest version. the older versions had different functions to generate gpt responses than the ones i have used.
