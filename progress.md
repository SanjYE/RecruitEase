#progress so far

*****final updates as of this friday*****
<br/>
--> backend functionality of understanding resume implemented
<br/>
--> placements data made into json and recognized by gpt in the back-end
<br/>
--> main.py is the main code that is the completed protoype backend
<br/>
--> placement_criteria.json is the json file containing the placement crierias for each company. This data was extracted from the 2 codes i have also provided....one converting the pdf data to text and the other converting the text data to json.
<br/>
--> gpt didn't allow the entire text data to be passed and converted to json so naturally i had to split the text file into several files and provide it one at a time. I then compiled all the fragmented json file data into the main json file uploaded in this repo.
